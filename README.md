# Overview
Our team is dedicated to studying and addressing the impact of social inequalities on health outcomes and health care service use. Our approach is interdisciplinary: we bring together insights from epidemiology, biology, social policy and econometrics. Our aim is to build the evidence base for interventions to reduce social inequalities in health over the lifecourse.
