# Overview
Our team at London Scool of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is dedicated to studying and addressing the impact of social inequalities on health outcomes and health care service use. Our approach is interdisciplinary: we bring together insights from epidemiology, biology, social policy and econometrics. Our aim is to build the evidence base for interventions to reduce social inequalities in health over the lifecourse.

## Leadership

## Research

Our research assesses how non-medical social policies influence health, disease and health care service use over the lifecourse. We have a particular interest in the health effects of early life, education and family policies. Our research activities are currently organised around two core themes:

(1)   Integrating social and biological sciences to improve our ability to evaluate the health effects of social policies and interventions in still young and healthy populations.

(2)   Leveraging administrative data linkages and historical randomized controlled trials to evaluate the long-term effects of social policies and interventions.
